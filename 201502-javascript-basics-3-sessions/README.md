# JavaScript Basics in 3 Sessions

This is a 3-session workshop being held at [Tech Liminal][tech-liminal].  See
[here][js-workshop-signup] for event details, or to sign up (before Feb. 5).

## Required Materials

First, you'll need a laptop.

Next, you'll need Chrome, which you can install [here][chrome-download].
Cross-browser JavaScript is beyond the scope of this workshop, so we're
making your life easier by picking a single browser to work with.  As a
side benefit, Chrome has excellent tools for developers.

Finally, you need a *proper* text editor, by which we mean a text editor
designed for programmers.  Unlike Notepad, good text editors come loaded with
features to help you work with code: syntax highlighting, refactoring tools,
configurations for common code styles...the list goes on.  Don't use Notepad
for programming - use one of these instead:

- [Atom][editor-atom] (Win, Mac)
- [Notepad++][editor-notepad-pp] (Win)
- [Sublime Text][editor-sublime-text] (Win, Mac)
